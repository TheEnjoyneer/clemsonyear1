%Question 1

%{
a) The type of engineering that I am interested in is Computer Engineering
b) I have a slight amount of coding experience as I have learned the basic
syntax for a couple different coding languages
c) I have dabbled in the coding languages of just regular C, Python, and
Apple's proprietary Swift programming language.
d) I personally would venture to say that my biggest challenge this term is
going to be learning the logical progression of commands that will render
useful programs for me in MatLab.
e) Personally I do not have any concerns about this class at the moment.

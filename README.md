Personal GitHub repository for archiving code written for classes at Clemson University

All code in this repository is free for anyone's use. I doubt it will be too terribly useful to very many people.
Any comments, constructive criticism, or concerns can be emailed to me or commented on the repo as well.

Contents should include code written for Clemson's classes on:
  > `Introduction to C Programming`
  
  > `Introduction to Logical Thinking (MATLAB Programming Language class)`
  
  > `Miscellaneous Code as well`
  
  All constructive comments are appreciated.
